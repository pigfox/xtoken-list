find me a API the provides the  below:

1. I want to query many DEXes, preferable ~50.

2. For each DEX, I want a list of many, ~2000 tokens, containing data like below.

[

{

    "decimals": "18",

    "price": "0.004534",

    "address": "0x269616d549d7e8eaa82dfb17028d0b212d11232a",

    "name": "CryptoPunks",

    "symbol": "PUNK",

    "totalSupply": "17720"

},

...

]

The age of the data should be very fresh, preferably < 60 secs.

API Recommendations for DEX Token Data

While there isn't a single API that perfectly matches all your requirements, here are some strong contenders that can be combined or used individually to achieve your desired outcome:

1. CoinGecko API

Strengths:
Comprehensive coverage of DEXs and tokens
Real-time data updates
User-friendly API
Considerations:
Might not provide data for every DEX or token you need
Rate limits can be restrictive for high-frequency usage
2. CoinAPI

Strengths:
Real-time cryptocurrency market data
Supports multiple DEXs and tokens
Flexible API with various endpoints
Considerations:
Pricing plans might be more expensive for extensive usage
3. The Graph

Strengths:
Highly customizable GraphQL API
Direct access to on-chain data
Powerful for complex data queries
Considerations:
Requires technical expertise to set up and query
Data freshness can depend on indexer performance
4. Bitquery

Strengths:
Powerful analytics platform with API access
Deep dive into DEX data and token interactions
Historical and real-time data
Considerations:
Might be more complex to use than simpler APIs
Pricing plans can vary based on usage
Combining APIs for Optimal Results

To achieve the best results, consider combining these APIs:

CoinGecko API: Use for a broad overview of DEXs and tokens, including basic information and pricing data.
The Graph: For specific, deep-dive queries into DEX and token data, especially when you need to analyze historical trends or complex interactions.
Bitquery: For advanced analytics and insights into DEX activity, token flows, and user behavior.
Additional Considerations:

Rate Limits: Be mindful of API rate limits to avoid being throttled. Consider using API management tools to optimize usage and distribute requests efficiently.
Data Freshness: While APIs strive for real-time data, there might be slight delays. For the most up-to-date information, consider combining API data with on-chain data directly from blockchain nodes.
Data Quality: Ensure the quality and accuracy of the data by validating it against multiple sources.
Cost: Evaluate the pricing models of different APIs to choose the most cost-effective solution for your specific needs.
By strategically combining these APIs and considering the factors mentioned above, you can effectively query multiple DEXs, retrieve data for a large number of tokens, and ensure the freshness and reliability of the information.
