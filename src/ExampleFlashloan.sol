/*
Improvements:
* Error Handling: Uses try...catch blocks to handle potential errors during flashloan requests and repayments.
* Flexibility: Accepts token addresses as parameters, allowing for more dynamic arbitrage strategies.
* Gas Optimization: Considers gas efficiency when performing swaps and interacting with contracts.
Additional Considerations:
* Slippage: Implement strategies to mitigate slippage, such as using a slippage tolerance or adjusting the swap amount based on market conditions.
* Price Oracles: Use price oracles to obtain accurate token prices and avoid unexpected losses.
* Market Conditions: Monitor market conditions and adjust your arbitrage strategies accordingly.
* Security: Prioritize security by using audited smart contracts and following best practices for contract development.
Remember: This code is a starting point and may require modifications to suit your specific needs and the characteristics of the arbitrage opportunity you want to exploit. Always test your contracts thoroughly before deploying them to a mainnet.
